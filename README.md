## A Time-travel scenario for GUMSHOE-based Roleplaying Games

This was an entry for the GUMSHOE Community Content Contest that unfortunately didn't win. Rather than try to polish this up I'm offering it to the world as-is with the trademarks removed in the hopes that someone will find it useful. Who knows? Maybe there's a market for time-travel adventures where someone is trying to stop vandals from interfering with the birth of personal computing?

All I ask is that if you decide to use this for something you let me know and credit me. I'm curious to see where this lands.
